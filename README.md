# Flight-Fare-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-and-Analysis-Using-Power-BI

This project focuses on predicting flight fares using diverse machine learning algorithms and presenting insightful analysis through a Power BI dashboard. Leveraging historical flight data, we apply machine learning techniques to accurately forecast flight prices. Additionally, we utilize Power BI to create interactive visualizations and a dashboard. Through this project, users can gain a deeper understanding of flight pricing dynamics, enabling them to make informed decisions when booking flights.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

The flight dataset underwent comprehensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and suitability for model training:

- **Data Cleaning**: Missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns were removed to enhance the integrity of the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: New features such as day of the week, month, and time of day were derived from date-time features to capture temporal patterns.
- **Categorical Variable Encoding**: Categorical variables were encoded into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding to facilitate model training.
- **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features were scaled to a similar range to prevent bias in model training and to improve convergence speed.

 ## Modelling

- **Linear Regression Model**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Bagging Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGB Regressor**
- **KNeighbors Regressor**
- **ExtraTrees Regressor**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**

## Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
- **R Squared**

Random Forest Regressor is the best model exhibiting low values for MAE, RMSE, MAPE and high value for R squared.

## Power BI Dashboard and Analysis

In addition to model building, a dynamic Power BI dashboard was developed to conduct in-depth analysis of the flight dataset.
